          <h3>Weather forecasting</h3>
          <p>
            Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to
            predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and
            time. People have attempted to predict the weather informally for
            millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are
            made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the
            atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the
            atmosphere will change. Once calculated by hand based mainly upon
            changes in barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky
            condition or cloud cover, weather forecasting now relies on
            computer-based models that take many atmospheric factors into
            account.[1] Human input is still required to pick the best possible
            forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern
            recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance,
            and knowledge of model biases. The inaccuracy of forecasting is due
            to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational
            power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere,
            the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an
            incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes. Hence, forecasts
            become less accurate as the difference between current time and the
            time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the
            forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help
            narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome. There are a
            variety of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are
            important forecasts because they are used to protect life and
            property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are
            important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity
            markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to
            estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use
            weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since
            outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and
            wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these
            events, and to plan ahead and survive them. In 2009, the US spent
            $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.
